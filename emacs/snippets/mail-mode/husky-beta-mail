Hello there!

I tagged the version ${1:RELEASE_TAG} for Husky.

You can find the APK of this version attached to the tag in the repository[tag].

You can find the changelog in this version by seeing the HISTORY[history] and a
more detailed log looking at the tag[tag].

Quick changelog:

  - $2

Since this is a beta release, there will be two different packages:

  - beta: You can install it over your actual Husky (if you are using these
    releases).

  - beta_pkg: It has a different package name, so you can have the stable
    version and the beta version installed along.

I recommend you to enable the CrashHanlder (Preferences -> Enable uncontrolled
crash email reporting) and send me the stacktrace if the application crashes.

Please report any bugs by sending an email to the devel mailist[husky-devel].
You may ask for features in the same mailist.

Updates at F-Droid are automated and there is not a date of when this release
will be published.

Cheers!

NOTE: the signature of this APK is not the same as the Husky releases at F-Droid
or the Play Store. Please uninstall the previous version and install this in
order to use this release.
