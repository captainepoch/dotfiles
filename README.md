Config files' backup.

## For what OS?
I actually use ArchLinux + XFCE and Mac OS X. So... I only tested on that set up (and everything is working very well).

## How is it done? (*backup.sh*)
There's a bash script called *backup.sh*. It copies all folders and files in which is stored all my config (vim, tmux, zsh, emacs...) from home.

Config is set up with the *set_config.sh* script to the home dir of the other of my computers.
